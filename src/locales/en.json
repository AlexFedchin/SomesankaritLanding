    "description": {
      "1": "The story of Somesankarit begins at the Nääshalli wrestling gym, where Mirko and Roman met. A shared passion and enthusiasm for creating short videos brought them together, and making videos became a fun joint venture.",
      "2": "Mirko and Roman are also known from nightclub doors, where they filmed content related to nightlife. Nightclubs were also their first short video marketing clients. This sparked the idea of transitioning from bouncer work to focusing entirely on short video marketing.",
      "3": "The idea gained momentum when the nightclub where Mirko and Roman worked announced, just a day before New Year's Eve, that it was closing its doors. Mirko came up with the idea of creating an open job application video explaining that they had become unemployed. The job application video was filmed and published on the first day of 2025, and through it, the video reached Matias Niemi, who hired them to create content for Same Goal Clothing's TikTok. The videos garnered over a million views in the first month, leading to a significant increase in demand for their services."
